  <h3>Web Developer</h3>

  <p class="text-lg paragraph">
    I started to take Web Development seriously in October 2021. Before this, I had built a few wordpress, squarespace
    and wix sites for friends and local companies. I had dabbled in Adobe Dreamweaver, HTML & CSS at a job in 2011, but
    there was a good 6-7 year gap until I touched any form of web design again. I re-sparked my interest upon leaving
    the military and doing a bit of freelance work in the transition, where I built some very basic sites and designed
    some logos and marketing material for a couple of local companies. From here, I mainly just dabbled with code and
    kept an eye on the tech industry whilst working as an electrician and smart home integrator.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg paragraph">
    Increasingly, as I worked on more and more smart home projects where I would be programming lighting systems and
    automating processes within the home, I realised that the technical, computer based work is what interested me the
    most, specifically when tailoring the UI and touch points for the customer. Naturally, I started self learning
    online and became extremely passionate about Web Development. I used resources such as <a href="#"
      class="p-link">Free Code Camp</a>, <a href="#" class="p-link">The Odin Project</a> & <a href="#"
      class="p-link">Udemy</a> to further my skills and deep dive into a new industry that I wanted to know everything
    about.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg paragraph">
    The idea of a bootcamp interested me and I found the guys at <a href="#" class="p-link">{The Jump} - Digital
      School</a>. I felt this was the most appropriate way for me to solidify my learning and get a foot in to the
    industry. This is where I am now and I will be finished with the course in August 2022.

  <p class="paragraph">I spent 6.5 years in the British Army as a Combat Engineer & Paratrooper. My relatively short,
    but fulfilling carrer is no doubt the most important period in my life to date. It was an experience that has
    moulded me to become the man I am today and I owe it everything. It instilled maturity, mental robustness and
    tenacity that I am not sure you can gain in any other line of work.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">The experience I gained here is invaluable. During my time I completed arduous courses, multiple
    grueling exercises, was pushed to my limits regularly and deployed on an operational tour. Each individual
    experience provided me with transferrable skills that I use daily.

  <h3>A list of other things i do...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="things">
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Motorcycles & Hobbies - </span>
        I grew up racing motocross and now spend a lot of weekends over the summer competing in enduro events with same
        group of friends I grew up with. In the winter, when I can get away, I get to the alps to ski & snowboard. </p>
    </li>
    <li class="things">
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outdoorsman- </span>
        My love of the outdoors came from my time in the Army. There's a huge benefit to stepping away from the screen
        and getting out in it, whatever the weather.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="things">
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dog owner - </span>
        I've got a dog, she's a Sprocker Spaniel called Rudy. She enjoys the outdoors too and both myself and my wife
        put
        a great deal of time into training her.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="things">
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fitness & Wellbeing - </span>
        I am a firm believer that our body & mind are our most valuable asset. It's very easy in todays work environment
        to prioritise other things. The military taught me to look after the machine that is our body, I do so by going
        to
        a crossfit gym 4 times a week, running and being aware of the food im eating.</p>

  <p>I am also a bit of a gear enthusiast. Inspired from a concept by <a href="https://wesbos.com/uses">Wes Bos</a>, I
    have set up a <a href="/uses">/uses</a> page to showcase what I use on a daily basis.
